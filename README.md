# NeuralNetwork
This is a neural network I developed during a school project. to run you can extract the jar file then type ./NeuralNetwork in the command line with the first argument being the name of the training file and the second argument being the pattern you want the neural netowrk to identify. For example ./NeuralNetwork training.txt 10001000111000100011100111 could be a valid usage but IMPORTANT NOTE: make sure that the length of second argument matches the length of all the second comma seperated values in the training file. Use the provided training text file as a reference.

Im planning on making this program interactable with a GUI so that the second argument is not necessary but still an option then later making a web version.
